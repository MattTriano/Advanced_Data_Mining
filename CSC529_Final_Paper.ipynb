    "The accuracy and performance of a machine learning classifier is highly dependent on the preprocessing steps applied to the data. With big data sets, inadequate data preprocessing or poor algorithm parameter selection can cause prohibitively long run times. My initial project focus was in exploring the performance of multiple base classifiers across multiple large ($n_{obs}>10,000$) with faint signals concerning financial risk. The time constraints of the project and the time costs of tuning classifiers revealed a more interesting project, namely to build a framework to streamline the process of testing different preprocessing configurations over a number of different base classifiers, and I used one large data set to evaluate this framework.  This involved experimenting with many different tools and I encountered a number of bugs in the current implementations of modules in the sklearn environment that \n",

    "Additionally, I am very interested in visualizing data (I took Dr. Eli Brown's CSC595 on Interactive Data Visualization last quarter and I loved it. I'm still proud of [my final project](http://bl.ocks.org/MattTriano/raw/154e9c142504d61985e2b65287e389be/)), so I spent a lot of time improving the visualizations for precision-recall relationships. This was another significant time consumer, and I suspect there may bugs in my implementations, as I was observing different results between different iterations.\n",

    "For a financial entity to maintain adequate financial reserves, that entity must be able to both accurately assess their exposure to risk. For a financial entity to make profitable loans, that entity must keep the proportion of bad loans (ie loans where the lendee fails to make payments on time) below some threshold proportion. Both of these goals require the financial entity to have a reasonably accurate method for discriminating between people who will default on that loan and people who will regularly make their payments on time."
