    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This research analyzed credit card debt defaults and explored five classifiers (AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forests, and Bagged Decision Trees (essentially random forest again)), and multiple data mining techniques in pursuit of a reliable method for discerning between high and low risk credit card users in a large, imbalanced data set. The target feature of the data set, default_payment $(1=\\text{yes}, \\; 0=\\text{no})$, is imbalanced with about $22\\%$ of the observed credit users defaulting in at least 1 of the 6 included months, so balancing techniques like SMOTE and SMOTETokem were explored with the 5 examined classifiers. For this business application, underestimating a cardholder's default risk can result in loss of liquidity or possible permanent loss of money, while overestimating a cardholder's credit risk can result in missed profit. As loss is much more costly than missed profit, I used recall and precision as the primary metrics for evaluating classifier performance, and I explored techniques for visualizing classifier performance, and I improved on sklearn's ROC curve visualization to present threshold information that enables an analyst to quickly evaluate the threshold to choose to identify the credit risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, A classifier's performance metrics can vary greatly depending on the data preprocessing steps, so as a secondary goal, I sought to develop a more general framework for streamlining the combination of preprocessing steps, with the intention of adding that framework to my toolbox for use with future problems.

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy and performance of a machine learning classifier, or in my case, an ensemble of classifiers, is highly dependent on the preprocessing steps applied to the data. With big data sets, inadequate data preprocessing or poor algorithm parameter selection can cause prohibitively long run times. My initial project focus was in exploring the performance of multiple base classifiers across multiple large ($n_{obs}>10,000$) with faint signals concerning financial risk. The time constraints of the project and the time costs of tuning classifiers revealed a more interesting project, namely to build a framework to streamline the process of testing different preprocessing configurations over a number of different base classifiers, and I used one large data set to evaluate this framework.  This involved experimenting with many different tools and attempting to adapt them to my use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I am very interested in visualizing data (I took Dr. Eli Brown's CSC595 on Interactive Data Visualization last quarter and I loved it. I'm still proud of [my final project](http://bl.ocks.org/MattTriano/raw/154e9c142504d61985e2b65287e389be/)), so I spent a lot of time improving the visualizations for precision-recall relationships. This was another significant time consumer, but I'm pleased with the results produced. "

    "### Risk Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For a financial entity to maintain adequate financial reserves, that entity must be able to both accurately assess their exposure to risk. For a financial entity to make profitable loans, that entity must keep the proportion of bad loans (ie loans where the lendee fails to make payments on time) below some threshold proportion. Both of these goals require the financial entity to have a reasonably accurate method for discriminating between people who will default on that loan and people who will regularly make their payments on time."

    "\n",
    "This data set was collected by a Taiwanese credit issuing company and was initially published by I-Cheng Yeh and Che-hui Lien with a paper on their **Sorting Smoothing Method** for estimating the real probability of default$^{I-ChengBIB}$. The data set includes 30000 total observations where each observation represents a 6 month stretch of payment history for a single cardholder and consists of 23 explanatory features and a binary label (defaulted or did-not-default). From the distributions below, we see that cardholders who default are much more likely to be on the younger end of the distribution, but as you move to the older end of the spectrum, the proportion of defaulters to non-defaulters increases significantly. We can also see that the 'Marriage' and 'Education' features include undefined data ($0.18\\%$ and $1.15\\%$ of observations are missing defined values for 'Marriage' and 'Education' respectively, with no overlap), with although it is not indicated as missing in the data and the prior researchers make no mention of handling it.

However, $\\text{EDUCATION}$ includes values $[0,4,5]$ and $\\text{MARRIAGE}$ includes values of $[0]$. \n",

    "I also explored imputing those values through application of multivariate imputation by chained equations$^{miceBIB}$ (or **MICE**), which assumes that missing values are Missing At Random and constructs arrays of equations by replacing missing values with feature means as placeholders. Single placeholder means are removed and a regression is performed using the data in the imputation set to predict the value. This process cycles through all missing values a number of times until the change is below a threshold and it stops running. As this method is using information from the entire data set to calculate the values to impute, this step must be performed after splitting the data into a testing and training set to avoid information leakage. I thought I found a way to correctly achieve this using sklearns Pipeline tool, but I was unable to replicate the performance seen in documentation and unfortunately, the Pipeline tool fails silently. I started implementing similar functionality into the manual cross-validators I built, but this was error-prone and slow.  \n",

    "\n",
    "For this problem, I reason that it's far more important to identify False-Negatives and True-Positives than it is to identify False-Positives and True-Negatives, as False-Negatives involve underestimating a potential lendee's creditworthiness (thereby putting money in the hands of people less likely to pay it back) and True-Positives involve correctly identifying and avoiding making bad loans.  False-Positives involve overestimating the risk of a loan, and thereby forgoing the potential profit. This is also undesirable, but it is more of a business concern to lose money than to fail to gain profit. These qualities are excellently expressed in the **ROC curve**$^{[ROCbib]}$, which essentially shows how accurate a classifier is in discriminating between and ranking true positives vs true negatives. ROC curves plot the True-Positive Rate (**TPR**) and False-Positive Rate (**FPR**) for a classifier. For a binary classifier, the TPR and FPR can be calculated using values from that binary classifier's confusion matrix, which consists of True-Positives (**TP**, actually positive and predicted positive), False-Positives (**FP**, actually negative but predicted positive), True-Negatives (**TN**, actually negative and predicted negative), and False-Negatives (**FN**, actually positive but predicted negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{False Positive Rate} = \\frac{FP}{FP+TN} \\qquad \\qquad \\text{precision}=\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{True Positive Rate} = \\text{recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN} \\;$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a curve, many points are connected together. The ROC curve is produces by sorting the list of (FPR,TPR) pairs and then plotting them from the lower left corner of of the figure as a series of connecting line segments. Technically, there's no information between those points, so the optimistic curve will go straight up from each point and then straight right to the next point, the pessimistic curve will go right from each point then up, or the average curve, which interpolates. Single discrete classifiers like decision trees produce a single confusion matrix, which corresponds to a single (fpr,tpr) pair, and a curve is built from an ensemble of this discrete classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic classifiers, however, do not make the binary predictions needed for a confusion matrix. Rather, they predict the probability that an instance will fall into a specific class. However, these probabilities can be converted to discrete values by applying a decision threshold, where probabilities below the threshold are treated as predicted negative and probabilities above the threshold are predicted positive. The curve is generated by choosing a range of thresholds and calculating the new confusion matrix values for each threshold value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fawcett discusses several other methods for producing curves from single discrete classifiers. With decision trees, one can look into the model and use the class proportions calculated at each node and aggregated. Alternatively,  an ensemble of classifiers can be bootstrapped together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The native sklearn implementation for generating ROC curves takes an array of true values and an array of probability estimates or decision_function scores and returns an array containing FPR points, TPR points corresponding to the FPR points at the same index, and the decision function thresholds that produced that (FPR, TPR) pair$^{ROCMetzBIB}$. The sklearn library didn't implement any functionality for easily including threshold information in the ROC curve, but this threshold information is simply a gradient of ordered values, which can easily be represented by a color gradient. In the March 12th presentations, one group included ROC curves (generated in R) that encoded threshold information as line color, but it used a rainbow color map which is a generally poor choice for data visualization as it doesn't have a logical mapping to human expectation (ie given a gradient of 2 colors, it's easy to interpret the value across the spectrum from one extreme to the other, but across a spectrum of many colors, our visual intuition breaks down and requires thought). I implemented a much better visualization that I'm very pleased with (see Fig. 3). By presenting threshold information in this way, an analyst can use the ROC curve to determine the actual threshold value to use to achieve a certain True Positive rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Curve Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve below describes the performance of a Random Forest classifier I trained. From the curve, we see that a threshold value of $0.9$ corresponds to a TPR of about $0.6$ and an FPR of about $0$. This classifier can return a decision score for a single case, and that an analyst can compare that score to a threshold to determine a proper business reaction. The addition of color makes it much easier for someone using the classifier to understand the cost of different choices for threshold."

To produce these visualizations across all of the folds of the cross validation, I had to collect and store data from each fold, and then pass appropriate data off to other functions to generate the visualizations.

    "The number of possible preprocessing dimensions quickly creates a large number of combinations to try. It quickly became apparent that a coherent framework would be necessary to both accelerate development of new models, as well as reduce the space for possible variations between models. I have been using Python's sklearn module (short for Scikit-Learn, part of the SciPy scientific computing stack) in school for a couple years now, but I haven't taken the time to really dig in and study the ecosystem. The developers that designed sklearn saw that this would be a massive project and put a lot of thought into designing the API so that the project would both be usable and maintainable.  They set the design principles that all objects should share a consistent interface, only learning algorithms will be represented by classes, it should be simple to inspect an object's parameters, default values should be reasonable (i.e. the value that generally performs best given other parameters), and wherever possible, objects should be modular so that they can be assembled to perform sequential or parallel tasks.\n",

I found a native solution to this problem in sklearn's Pipeline interface, although, ultimately I wasn't able to get the (allegedly) fully sklearn-compliant library Imbalanced-learn$^{[ImbLearnBIB]}$ to properly apply class balancing in a pipeline. This caused a number of headaches and was a very difficult bug to diagnose, but by the 6th implementation of a manual cross-validator, I was able to integrate both class balancing and simulate a pipeline and apply a normalizing step (although I just discovered that the Imbalanced-Learn library polluted the namespace and caused the incorrect pipeline implementation to be called, resulting in an aggregate of 8+ hours of high-load computing that produced results that weren't significantly different from other runs).\n",

Fit the GridSearch using the training data and then check for overfitting by comparing the recall_scores and precision_scores produced by predictions from the training set and corresponding testing set. (Tip: save the estimator returned by GridSearchCV, it will save you several minutes if you want to use it again.)\n",
